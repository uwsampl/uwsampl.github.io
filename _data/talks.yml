  location: "CSE 505"
  speaker: ["Woosuk Kwon", "UC Berkeley", "https://woosuk.me/"]
  date: "Sept 29th, 2023"
  abstract: "High throughput serving of large language models (LLMs) requires batching sufficiently many requests at a time. However, existing systems struggle because the key-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size. To address this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging techniques in operating systems. On top of it, we build vLLM, an LLM serving system that achieves (1) near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage. Our evaluations show that vLLM improves the throughput of popular LLMs by 2-4× with the same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art systems, such as FasterTransformer and Orca. The improvement is more pronounced with longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms. vLLM's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm"

  location: "CSE2 271"
  speaker: ["Ying Sheng", "Stanford", "https://sites.google.com/view/yingsheng/home"]
  date: "May 22th, 2023"
  abstract: "The high computational and memory requirements of large language model (LLM) inference traditionally make it feasible only with multiple high-end accelerators. Motivated by the emerging demand for latency-insensitive tasks with batched processing, this paper initiates the study of high-throughput LLM inference using limited resources, such as a single commodity GPU. We present FlexGen, a high-throughput generation engine for running LLMs with limited GPU memory. FlexGen can be flexibly configured under various hardware resource constraints by aggregating memory and computation from the GPU, CPU, and disk. Through a linear programming optimizer, it searches for efficient patterns to store and access tensors. FlexGen further compresses these weights and the attention cache to 4 bits with negligible accuracy loss. These techniques enable FlexGen to have a larger space of batch size choices and thus significantly increase maximum throughput. As a result, when running OPT-175B on a single 16GB GPU, FlexGen achieves significantly higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art offloading systems, reaching a generation throughput of 1 token/s for the first time with an effective batch size of 144. On the HELM benchmark, FlexGen can benchmark a 30B model with a 16GB GPU on 7 representative sub-scenarios in 21 hours. The code is available at https://github.com/FMInference/FlexGen"

  date: "Oct 13th, 2022"
  abstract: 'Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs), as the backbone of graph-based machine learning, demonstrate great success in various domains (e.g., e-commerce). However, the performance of GNNs is usually unsatisfactory due to the highly sparse and irregular graph-based operations. To this end, we propose, TC-GNN, the first GPU Tensor Core Unit (TCU) based GNN acceleration framework. The core idea is to reconcile the "Sparse" GNN computation with "Dense" TCU. Specifically, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the sparse operations in mainstream GNN computing frameworks. We introduce a novel sparse graph translation technique to facilitate TCU processing of sparse GNN workload. We also implement an effective CUDA core and TCU collaboration design to fully utilize GPU resources. We fully integrate TC-GNN with the Pytorch framework for ease of programming. Rigorous experiments show an average of 1.70X speedup over the state-of-the-art Deep Graph Library framework across various GNN models and dataset settings.'

  abstract: 'This talk is relatively new work on compiling sparse tensor algebra to dataflow hardware and accelerators, in collaboration with MIT and Stanford University. We propose the Sparse Abstract Machine (SAM), an intermediate representation and abstract machine model for targeting sparse tensor algebra to reconfigurable and fixed-function spatial dataflow accelerators. SAM defines a streaming abstraction with sparse primitives that encompass fused sparse tensor algebra expressions for arbitrary dataflow. SAM dataflow graphs naturally separate tensor formats from algorithms and is expressive enough to incorporate many sparse-iteration and hardware-specific optimizations. We show an automatic compilation technique from a high-level language to SAM. We also show how SAM can be leveraged to develop new hardware for sparse tensor algebra. '

- title: "Programming Abstractions and Efficient Compilation Techniques for Modern FPGAs"
  speaker: ["Luis Vega", "UW", "https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~vegaluis/"]
  date: "May 5th, 2022"
  abstract: "Modern field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have recently powered high-profile efficiency gains in systems from datacenters to embedded devices by offering ensembles of heterogeneous, reconfigurable hardware units. Programming stacks for FPGAs, however, are stuck in the past— they are based on traditional hardware languages, which were appropriate when FPGAs were simple, homogeneous fabrics of basic programmable lookup tables. Nowadays, FPGAs are highly heterogeneous architectures that support a wide variety of compute operations such as scalar, vector, fused, and floating-point arithmetic together with different kinds of programmable memories. Unfortunately, the behavioral semantics available in hardware languages today cannot effectively capture these architectural advances, resulting in inefficient programs that are missing all the benefits of specialization. An example of this abstraction gap is that vector operations cannot be described behaviorally for targeting vector hardware (SIMD) available in modern FPGAs.

This thesis describes Reticle, a new low-level abstraction for FPGA programming that, unlike existing languages, explicitly represents the special-purpose units available on a particular FPGA device. Reticle has two levels: a portable intermediate language and a target-specific assembly language. The design goal of the intermediate language is to describe behavior, while the assembly language aims for layout. Furthermore, I demonstrate how to lower intermediate programs to assembly programs, using instruction selection which can be both faster and deterministic compared to existing technology mapping approaches. I use Reticle to implement compute centric benchmarks, such as linear algebra operators and coroutines, and find that Reticle compilation runs up to 100 times faster than current approaches while producing comparable or better run-time and utilization. Additionally, I show how using Reticle’s memory instructions can lead to 5.26𝑥 performance improvement on an existing encryption application (AES)."

  speaker: ["Jiawei Liu", "UIUC", "https://jw-liu.xyz/"]
  date: "May 12th, 2022"
  location: "CSE2 274"
  abstract: "In the past decade, Deep Learning (DL) systems have been widely deployed in various application domains to facilitate our daily life, e.g., natural language processing, healthcare, activity recognition, and autonomous driving. Meanwhile, it is extremely challenging to ensure the correctness of DL systems (e.g., due to their intrinsic nondeterminism), and bugs in DL systems can cause serious consequences and may even threaten human lives. In the literature, researchers have explored various techniques to test, analyze, and verify DL models, since their quality directly affects the corresponding system behaviors. Recently, researchers have also proposed novel techniques for testing the underlying operator-level DL libraries, which provide general binary implementations for each high-level DL operator and are the foundation for running DL models on different hardware platforms. However, there is still limited work targeting the reliability of the emerging tensor compilers (also known as DL compilers), which aim to automatically compile high-level tensor computation graphs directly into high-performance binaries for better efficiency, portability, and scalability than traditional operator-level libraries.
In this talk, I'll introduce Tzer, a practical fuzzing technique for the widely used TVM tensor compiler. Tzer focuses on mutating the low-level Intermediate Representation (IR) for TVM due to the limited mutation space for the high-level IR. Our experimental results show that Tzer substantially outperforms existing fuzzing techniques on tensor compiler testing. To date, Tzer has detected 49 previously unknown bugs for TVM, with 37 bugs confirmed and 25 bugs fixed (PR merged)."

  speaker: ["Yu Tang", "National University of Defense Technology (NUDT)", ""]
  date: "May 26, 2022"
  location: "CSE2 274"
  abstract: "With the development of large-scale deep neural networks, significant success has been achieved in various domains. Nevertheless, the further development of deep neural networks is hampered by the limited GPU memory resource. Therefore, the optimization of GPU memory resources is highly demanded. Swapping and recomputation are commonly applied to make better use of GPU memory in deep learning. However, as an emerging domain, several challenges remain: 1) The efficiency of recomputation is limited for both static and dynamic methods. 2) Swapping requires researchers to offload parameters manually, which incurs a great time cost. 3) There is no such dynamic and fine-grained method that involves tensor swapping together with tensor recomputation nowadays. To remedy the above issues, we propose a novel scheduler manager named DELTA (Dynamic tEnsor offLoad and recompuTAtion). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to make a reasonable dynamic runtime scheduler on the combination of tensor swapping and tensor recomputation without user oversight. In DELTA, we firstly propose a filter algorithm to select the optimal tensors to be released out of GPU memory and secondly present a director algorithm to select a proper action for each of these tensors. Furthermore, prefetching and overlapping are deliberately considered to overcome the time cost caused by swapping and recomputing tensors. Experimental results show that DELTA not only saves 40%-70% of GPU memory, surpassing the state-of-the-art method to a great extent, but also gets comparable convergence results as the baseline with acceptable time delay. Also, DELTA gains 2.04× maximum batchsize when training ResNet-50 and 2.25× when training ResNet-101 compared with the baseline. Besides, comparisons between the swapping cost and recomputation cost in our experiments demonstrate the importance of making a reasonable dynamic scheduler on tensor swapping and tensor recomputation, which refutes the arguments in some related work that swapping should be the first and best choice."

  abstract: "Deep learning-based solutions achieve significant advancements in tasks such as natural language processing, image classification, and recommendation. As more sophisticated models are developed, the increasing training time and memory footprint force practitioners to use distributed training. State-of-the-art distributed training algorithms use iterative synchronization among participating nodes to ensure model consistency and correctness, putting a heavy burden on network communication. Furthermore, hardware accelerators are improving at a faster rate than network bandwidth growth. As a result, the communication phase of distributed training is frequently the bottleneck. In this talk, I will discuss three approaches to dealing with communication bottlenecks: application-level, network-level, and co-design solutions.

  speaker: ["Steven Lyubomirsky", "UW", "https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sslyu/"]
  date: "Apr 14th, 2022"
  recording: ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf5iWmSAADA', 'public']
  abstract: "As the scaling and performance demands for deep learning systems have grown, system designers have struggled to incorporate innovations at opposite ends of the system stack: more varied and complex deep learning models and specialized hardware accelerators. New models that use data structures and dynamic control flow to address new learning problems cannot immediately benefit from previous system-level optimizations, which are defined over static dataflow graphs. Meanwhile, many novel hardware accelerators for accelerating common deep learning operations present unusual computing models and often require manual modification of applications to use, demanding expertise in both the deep learning domain and in hardware. The challenges in adding support for accelerators in existing compiler stacks slow development cycles and constrain deep learning systems' capabilities and efficiency.

Following earlier work on the Relay IR for the TVM framework, this dissertation demonstrates that system design problems in the deep learning domain can be approached by formalizing deep learning models as programs broadly (rather than assuming a more specific structure like a graph) and applying traditional compiler engineering techniques, simplifying various optimizations and transformations. In particular, this work addresses the use of runtime systems to support optimizations for dynamic deep learning models and on systematically supporting accelerators through the use of a formal software/hardware interface. Traditional deep learning model optimizations have been conceived as transformations on static dataflow graphs, but can be adapted to perform similar reasoning dynamically (and hence make no assumptions about control flow) by performing similar reasoning in a runtime system, guided by heuristics that depend on dynamically gathered information. This work details the specific example of Dynamic Tensor Rematerialization, which is an online approach to the problem of gradient checkpointing (recomputing intermediate activations instead of storing them to reduce the memory required for training) that achieves results comparable to optimal static techniques but generalizes to arbitrarily dynamic models. In addressing the problem of supporting accelerators in deep learning compiler stacks, this work demonstrates that a formal software/hardware interface enables traditional compiler techniques like instruction selection to be adapted for accelerators. Namely, this work presents a methodology for implementing a compiler stack with extensible support for accelerators that uses term rewriting to automatically discover opportunities to apply accelerator operations and lays the foundations for extending formal verification to entire compilation stacks with accelerator support."

  abstract: "Alpa automates model-parallel training of large deep learning (DL) models by generating execution plans that unify data, operator, and pipeline parallelism. Existing model-parallel training systems either require users to manually create a parallelization plan or automatically generate one from a limited space of model parallelism configurations, which does not suffice to scale out complex DL models on distributed compute devices. Alpa distributes the training of large DL models by viewing parallelisms as two hierarchical levels: inter-operator and intra-operator parallelisms. Based on it, Alpa constructs a new hierarchical space for massive model-parallel execution plans. Alpa designs a number of compilation passes to automatically derive the optimal parallel execution plan in each independent parallelism level and implements an efficient runtime to orchestrate the two-level parallel execution on distributed compute devices. Our evaluation shows Alpa generates parallelization plans that match or outperform hand-tuned model-parallel training systems even on models they are designed for. Unlike specialized systems, Alpa also generalizes to models with heterogeneous architectures and models without manually-designed plans."

In this talk, I will describe two ideas that help improve the resource efficiency of model training.

In the first half of the talk, I will discuss how pipelining can be used to accelerate distributed training. Pipeline parallelism facilitates model training with lower communication overhead than previous methods while still ensuring high compute resource utilization. Pipeline parallelism also enables the efficient training of large models that do not fit on a single worker; for example, we used pipeline parallelism at Nvidia to efficiently scale training to language models with a trillion parameters on 3000+ GPUs.

In the second half of this talk, I will describe how resources in a shared cluster with heterogeneous compute resources (e.g., different types of hardware accelerators) should be partitioned among different users to optimize objectives specified over one or more training jobs. Heterogeneity-aware scheduling can improve various scheduling objectives, such as average completion time, makespan, or cloud computing resource cost, by up to 3.5x."

  abstract: "Graph neural networks (GNN) have shown great success in learning from graph-structured data. They are widely used in various applications, such as recommendation, fraud detection, and search. In these domains, the graphs are typically large, containing hundreds of millions of nodes and several billions of edges. To scale graph neural network training on large graphs, we adopt hybrid CPU/GPU mini-batch training, in which we store graph data and sample nodes and their neighbors in CPU, and perform mini-batch computation in GPUs. In this talk, I will discuss the optimizations for GNN mini-batch training in two aspects. First, I will discuss our effort of scaling GNN training to a cluster of CPU and GPUs. We develop multiple optimizations to address the challenges in distributed hybrid CPU/GPU training (reduce data movement and balance the load in mini-batch computation). With these optimizations, we show close to good speedup without compromising model accuracy and train GNN models on a graph with 100M nodes with less than 1 minute in a cluster of 32 GPUs. In the second part, I will discuss a new neighbor sampling algorithm called global neighbor sampling (GNS) to reduce the data copy from CPU to GPUs. This algorithm efficiently samples neighbor nodes that are already stored in a GPU cache to reduce data copy from CPU to GPU. We show that our neighbor sampling algorithm can achieve state-of-the-art model performance while speeding the mini-batch training by a factor of 2 to 14 compared with the previous state-of-the-art algorithms."

  abstract: "With the pursuit of improving compute performance under strict power constraints, there is an increasing need for deploying applications to heterogeneous hardware architectures with spatial accelerators such as FPGAs. However, although these heterogeneous computing platforms are becoming widely available, they are very difficult to program especially with FPGAs. As a result, the use of such platforms has been limited to a small subset of programmers with specialized hardware knowledge. In this talk, I will first present SuSy, a programming framework composed of a domain-specific language (DSL) and a compilation flow that enables programmers to productively build high-performance systolic arrays on FPGAs. With SuSy, programmers express the design functionality in the form of uniform recurrence equations (UREs). The URE description in SuSy is followed by a set of decoupled spatial mapping primitives that specify how to map the equations to a spatial architecture. More concretely, programmers can apply space-time transformations and several other memory and I/O optimizations to build a highly efficient systolic architecture productively.

After that, I will present HeteroCL, an open-source programming infrastructure composed of a Python-based domain-specific language and an FPGA-targeted compilation flow. Similar to SuSy, HeteroCL cleanly decouples algorithm specifications from three important types of hardware customization in compute, data types, and memory architectures. In addition, HeteroCL produces highly efficient hardware implementations for a variety of popular workloads by targeting spatial architecture templates such as systolic arrays and stencil with dataflow architectures."

  abstract: "Search-based techniques have been demonstrated effective in solving complex optimization problems that arise in domain-specific compilers for machine learning (ML). Unfortunately, deploying such techniques in production compilers is impeded by several limitations. In this talk, I will present an autotuner for production ML compilers that can tune both graph-level and subgraph-level optimizations at multiple compilation stages. The autotuner applies a flexible search methodology that defines a search formulation for joint optimizations by accurately modeling the interactions between different compiler passes. The autotuner tunes tensor layouts, operator fusion decisions, tile sizes, and code generation parameters in XLA, a production ML compiler, using various search strategies. We demonstrate how to incorporate machine learning techniques such as a learned cost model and various learning-based search strategies to reduce autotuning time. Our learned cost model has high accuracy and outperforms a heavily-optimized analytical performance model. In an evaluation across 150 ML training and inference models on Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), the autotuner offers up to 2.4x and an average 5% runtime speedup over the heavily-optimized XLA compiler. The autotuner has been deployed to automatically tune the most heavily-used production models in Google’s fleet everyday."
